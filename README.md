# Rosetta

[![travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/TeamWanari/rosetta.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/TeamWanari/rosetta)

This is a localization library to simplify Flutter localization with the help of code generation. It generates getter functions for the localized keyset, so you don't have to worry about typos in String keys any more. 

**IMPORTANT:**
* Dart2 is required to use this package.
* This project is designed for Flutter applications only
* This project is intended to be used with `flutter_localizations` library
